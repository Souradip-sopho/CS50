0.  It is the longest word in the english dictionary.It is a medical term.
1.  According to the 'man' page,'getrusage' returns resource usage statistics ,like running time and memory used, of the calling process or other subprocesses called by that process.
2.  16
3.  By passing them by reference,the time and space for creating a copy of the entire structure is saved.
4.  In main,firstly the words inside the dictionary is loaded into a temporary memory storage by the function load(dictionary).Then the text file is processed by storing one word at each step from the text in a character array.Each word is scanned character by character.Whenever any non-alphabetic character is encountered other than apostrophe,or any word having length greater than 45 is encountered it is skipped.After storing the word in the array it is spell-checked using check(word).Accordingly number of misspelled word is noted and printed.In the last step the entire memory for storing the dictionary words are freed.The time taken by the processes are also taken into account and printed. 
5.  If fscanf is used,a word containing any characters other than alphabets and apostrophe are also included,which according to the problem specification should not be done .
6.  Because the parameters passed must not be modified by the calling function.
7.  A hash table was used for storing the words in the dictionary into memory.Inside the hashtable,to avoid collison,linked lists were used where each node consists of a character array of size 46,so that can store the largest word of length 45,and also a pointer to the next node. 
8.  The first time the code started working ,it was quite fast.
9.  The length of the hashtable was modified to make the code run faster.
10. The hash function used does not totally produce uniform hashing.A more perfect hash function was required.Also could not remove some memory leaks.
